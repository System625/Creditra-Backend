/**
 * Minimal async job queue abstraction.
 *
 * Designed for at-least-once delivery semantics:
 * - Jobs are retried up to `maxAttempts` times with exponential backoff.
 * - Jobs that exceed `maxAttempts` are moved to a dead-letter set and logged
 *   so operators can inspect and replay them.
 * - A `visibilityTimeoutMs` prevents a job from being re-attempted before its
 *   backoff window expires (analogous to SQS visibility timeout).
 *
 * The current implementation is purely in-memory and single-process. The
 * public interface is kept narrow so a Redis or SQS backend can be swapped in
 * without changing call sites.
